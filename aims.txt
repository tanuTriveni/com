1A. Program For converting all small case letters to UPPER case letters and Vice-Versa.

1 B. Program to count the words, spaces, and lines in a given input file. 

2A. LEX program to eliminate comment lines (Single and Multiple) in a text(C program)  file and copy the resulting program into a separate file.  

2B. YACC program to recognize valid identifier, operators and keywords in the given text  (C program) file. 

3A Develop a LEX program to recognize valid arithmetic expression. Identifiers in the expression
could be only integers and operators could be + and *. Count the identifiers & operators
present and print them separately.

3B. Develop a YACC program to evaluate arithmetic expression involving operators: +, -, *, and /.

4  Develop, Implement and execute a program using YACC/Bison tool to recognize all strings
ending with b preceded by n aâ€™s using the grammar a n b (note: input n value), also create DFA
of given grammar using JFLAP

5 Develop a program to find FIRST and FOLLOW of all variables. Write a suitable data structure to
store a context fee grammar. Prerequisite is to eliminate left recursion from the grammar
before storing.
